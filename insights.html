            One of the largest problems facing small and local businesses all
            around our communities is reaching customers. By providing a
            platform where businesses can connect with each other and their
            customers with a lower investment they will be able to expand their
            operations and outreach. As a bonus customers have an outlet to find
            new shops and services that they may have never found.

            The business landscape is constantly changing and we have moved into
            an age where nearly anything is at our fingertips using online

            lives easier but has come to the detriment of community which seems
            to be lacking. By giving these businesses a platform to connect with
            the customers who need their products it is possible to bring that
            sense of community back.
