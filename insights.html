            Our Solution
          </h2>
          <p class="lead text-right">
            One of the largest problems facing small and local businesses all
            around our communities is reaching customers. By providing a
            platform where businesses can connect with each other and their
            customers with a lower investment they will be able to expand their
            operations and outreach. As a bonus customers have an outlet to find
            new shops and services that they may have never found.

          <p class="lead">
            The business landscape is constantly changing and we have moved into
            an age where nearly anything is at our fingertips using online
            shopping. This has been a huge positive as it makes our everyday
            lives easier but has come to the detriment of community which seems
            to be lacking. By giving these businesses a platform to connect with
            the customers who need their products it is possible to bring that
            sense of community back.
